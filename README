Catch & Run is awesome Multiplayer GPS Game in development. It was my bachelor's thesis and I will continue working on it during my Master Thesis. I welcome any help, especially for clients. Android client is open-sourced here, other clients (iPhone, Windows Phone, ...) can be easily created by someone.
